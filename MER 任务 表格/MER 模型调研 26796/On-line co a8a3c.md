备注: Time continuous observer annotations are averaged and ‘re-sampled’ at 1 Hz such that the ‘ground truth’ for every segment of 1 s length corresponds to the average of all available annotations within that segment. After pre-selection, 100 qualified annotators participated in the AMT experiment. Annotation was done by mouse movements, separately for arousal and valence.
